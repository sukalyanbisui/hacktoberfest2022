HTML  is hypertext-markup-language.
It is the standard markup language for creating webpages.
"Markup" refers to how HTML “marks up” the page with annotations within the HTML file.
With HTML, not only can you format documents with headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements — you can also embed images, 
videos, audio files, and other multimedia via hyperlinks. 
And, you can link to other web pages on the same website or from another site. 
This allows visitors to easily navigate your website and jump between websites stored on different web servers.
